# Final-Project

This project uses the LSTM model to take data from 4 stock tickers over a 3 month period to predict Google's Adjusted Close. The notebook features the data normalization and preprocessing and then displays the correlations between all of the inputs. We then create a model splitting into a 80/10/10 train, validate, test datasets to construct the model and build different layers for an optimal fitting.
