# Project Title

## Objective
In this data science project, our main goal was to determine Google's adjusted close given information surrounding days, such as Volume, Open, Close, High, Low and similar ticker information such as Netflix, Microsoft, Apple.

## Dataset
For this analysis, we used the (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/stock-market-performance-case-study). The dataset that is going to be used for this project features stock market information for four companies, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Google. It features a three month data range where every open market day has the companies open, close, high, low, and adjusted close stock price for the period. It also features the volume of trades for that day(how many shares are traded). This is public data which can be found by exploring pretty much any finance site as all of these numbers are public knowledge and checked across multiple platforms. This dataset was last updated in May and therefore features data from February 7th to May 5th of 2023. Given this dataset the plan is to determine the expected adjusted close stock price for one company Google. We will create a model to determine this value given the opening price, highs, lows, and volume traded for both Google and also the other three companies as their is expected to be correlation due to being in the same industry. It would be more beneficial to have a wider range of dates for this model, however this range should be enough to create a valid model to determine expected stock closing price.

## Data Exploration and Insights
- During the exploration phase, we observed [mention any key insights or interesting patterns you discovered in the data].
- [Add more insights if relevant]
- [Insert your data visualisations along with insights here]

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure data quality and suitability for modeling, we performed the following preprocessing steps:

- [Add more preprocessing steps if necessary]

## Feature Selection/Engineering
We conducted feature selection/engineering to improve model performance. The selected features were:
- [Insert selected feature 1]
- [Add more selected features if applicable]

## Model Selection
After analyzing different algorithms, we chose [insert algorithms you chose for building the predictive models, e.g., linear regression, random forest, deep neural networks, etc.] as they are well-suited for this task.
- [Add reasoning for choosing the selected algorithms]

## Model Training and Evaluation
The dataset was split into training and testing sets. We used [insert cross validation method] to select the best model. 
- The models were assessed based on [insert evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.], producing the following results:
  - Model 1: [insert evaluation metrics for model 1]
  - Model 2: [insert evaluation metrics for model 2]
  - [Add more models and their evaluation metrics if applicable]
